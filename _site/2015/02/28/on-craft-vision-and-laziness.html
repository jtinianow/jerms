		<p class="post-excerpt">A few years ago, I was doing a bit of design work for a sustainability consulting firm. Their client, one of the largest private property owners in the U.S., had contracted with my client to launch a food-waste management initiative in their campus’s cafeterias. I was brought on to make my client&rsquo;s presentations look nice, and to create a spec brand for the initiative.</p>
		<p>I was pretty green at the time and thought that my client’s client might go ahead and use whatever logo I drafted up without providing additional compensation on my end. Since I knew that they were a huge corporation, and could easily afford to pay extra, I went ahead and registered copyrights for the logo.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the initiative never got off the ground. Nor did my (as I now realize) crappy little logo ever see the light of day.</p>

<p>In the interim, I spent hours filling out forms, talking to lawyer friends, and trying to coordinate an absolutely byzantine fee structure just in case my client’s client really wanted to use the logo I designed. It was a huge waste of time.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that I was too focused on protecting my idea, and I’ve learned a bit over the last few years about what actually matters in creative work. I’ve boiled it down to a few key points. They aren’t extensive, merely what most sticks out in my mind.</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>Vision comes first. Vision is the porch light you leave on when you head out into the night. Without it, projects become schizophrenic, bloated, and unrealistic.</p>

<p>Henry Ford had vision.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, that’s not all. Ford wanted to make cars that the average American could afford. It took ten years of manufacturing prohibitively expensive cars before he could achieve that goal.</p>

<p>Henry Ford was in his late forties before he rolled out the first assembly line and began mass producing the famous Model T.</p>

<p>The Model A came first because it could. It didn’t require the assembly line. And neither did the Model T. But Ford’s vision started with changing how people can move around, and followed through to making the automobile accessible. The assembly line, certainly a much more significant invention, had to come later.</p>

<p>The assembly line of Ford’s invention has been adapted to virtually every type of manufacturing. Today, it’s not Ford, but rather General Motors that has the largest share of the US auto market. GM may not have invented the assembly line, but perhaps they have put it to better use.</p>

<p>The point is, version one is not in fact the key piece of the puzzle. Maybe the vision is more crucial. Then again, there’s always more to the puzzle.</p>

<h2>Craft</h2>

<p>Vision without craft is useless. Microsoft has a bad habit of making commercials that illustrate a beautiful vision of the future, without any real substance to back their vision up. We’re shown happy faces of people effortlessly using technology to better their lives. Too bad that it’s all smoke and mirrors — none of that technology actually exists yet.</p>

<p>In stark contrast, Apple focuses on the product first and then advertises it. With rare exception (i.e. the iWatch), we don’t see Apple commercials with yet-to-be developed products. We see finely crafted products and we see how these very real things can enrich our lives.</p>

<p>I was interested to learn that the first digital tablet was made in 1987. The Linus Write-Top may have paved the way, but like Henry Ford’s assembly line, version one was not enough. When Steve Jobs “stole” the idea, he improved it. The level of craft is what sets the iPad apart, not the mere fact that it has a touch screen.</p>

<p>Every detail counts. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. You just have to make the best damn wheel possible.</p>

<p>Virgin Airlines does well because every detail of the experience has been carefully crafted. Richard Branson didn’t invent the airplane, or the airline, or anything else involved in the air travel experience. Similarly, Southwest Airlines didn’t reinvent the wheel — they just figured out how to be “the low-budget airline”. In either case, it’s the details that matter, not who came up with what first.</p>

<p>You can steal an idea, but you can’t steal craft. You have to earn it.</p>

<h2>Laziness</h2>

<p>Laziness, in the sense of avoidance of (unnecessary) activity can be a virtue too. This is different than sloth, which is to say complete and utter apathy. These definitions might be a bit subjective, but for the sake of argument, let’s bear in mind that laziness can be equated with not doing things.</p>

<p>Not doing things is good. There are a lot of things to do when creating, and the more you take on, the less likely that you’ll be able to focus on both a focused vision and a high level of craft.</p>

<p>This is why creatives should steal. Be careless about marshaling resources, and every victory will be pyrrhic. I’ve seen this during my time in the apparel industry. Everyone steals ideas and honestly, your customers aren’t buying your ideas, they’re buying your products.</p>

<p>There’s also the aspect of efficiency. Working hard is easy, and it can be rewarding. On the other hand, hard work is also exhausting. When you spend all your time trying to do things “from scratch”, it’s damn near impossible to stay competitive. Too much time spent on “originality” can easily lead to problems with craft.</p>

<h2>Amateurism Obstructs, Experience Shares</h2>

<p>What I learned from my little logo debacle back then is that where amateurs build walls around their precious ideas, experts share them. Because experts don’t have the best ideas, they have the clearest vision, the highest craft, and the cleverest minds.</p>
