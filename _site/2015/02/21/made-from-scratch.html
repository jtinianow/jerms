<section class="post__wrapper wrapper">
	<div class="post__container container">
		<p class="post-excerpt">From spring of 2012 until now, I&rsquo;ve gone from student to professional, back to student. Switching between these roles, I&rsquo;ve become aware of a crucial difference between them. As a professional, I can (and must) be very efficient, always bringing on new projects, always delivering by a hard deadline. As a student, the rules aren&rsquo;t as strict. I can be slow and make mistakes, and at the end of the day it&rsquo;s a learning experience.</p>
		<p>As a student, I have the freedom to do things the long, hard, stupid way.
Don’t get me wrong, I care about the work I do as a student. And it’s not that
I enjoy making mistakes, simply that I’ve found a lot of value in the freedom
to screw up, throw it away, and start over again.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of the hard reset. I’ve learned that if it takes me ten hours to
build version one, I can do version two from scratch in four, and version
three in two. It’s no that I learn that fast, it’s more that by starting with
the “everything from scratch” mentality forces me to consider and account for
every factor, and more importantly to find opportunities in the hurdles.</p>

<h2>And Then There Are Side Projects.</h2>

<p>I’ve always thought that student status was a sort of permission slip that
allowed me to take a break from the real world and slow down. But I’ve
realized that, even in my own experience, the student/professional dichotomy
is a false one. Frank Chimero exemplifies the long, hard, stupid approach to
professional work (and explains the idea beautifully).</p>

<h2>Thank You Cards</h2>

<p>A couple of years ago, when I was a struggling freelancer and nobody was
paying me, I decided that side projects might be a good way to keep the stress
from ruining my day. I’d read some of Jessica Hische’s thoughts on
procrastiworking and the benefit of side projects. More recently, the folks at
Crew published an article on the subject of how launching Unsplash saved them
from going out of business.</p>

<p>So I needed something to focus on, and I’ve always been interested in
printmaking. I never had time to take a course in undergrad. Now I found
myself with far too much free time, and access to the Columbus Idea Foundry’s
30,000 square foot makerspace.</p>

<p>I decided that this was a great opportunity to get into something that I’d
been interested in. I even knew what I was going print: thank you cards.
Figuring you can never have too many, I sketched out my design and got ready
to print it.</p>

<h2>Pay to Play</h2>

<p>There was just one catch: printmaking is expensive. For someone who doesn’t
already own the equipment, the barrier to entry is pretty high (I later got
into screen printing, but only with the help of grant).</p>

<p>The hacker culture and DIY ethic that surrounded me at the Idea Foundry pushed
to figure out some way that I could take on printmaking without a large
budget.</p>

<h2>Opensource Saves The Day</h2>

<p>I forget how I came upon the term “bottle jack printing press,” but one Google
search and I was set. Long time printmaker Charles Morgan published his plans
for a printing press that you can build for less than $150, and conveniently,
I already had access to a full woodshop and plenty of scrap material to work
with.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-02-21-made-from-scratch/press.jpg" alt="The press"></p>

<p>This is the press I built.</p>

<h2>…But That Doesn’t Mean It Was Easy</h2>

<p>I set out to build the press, and with the help of a couple friends, was up
and running in about a day and a half. Then everything went downhill. I had
spent just about all I had on the press, which left no funds for ink,
linoleum, or paper. I was stuck with what I could scrounge up: crap quality
ink, thin paper, and (luckily) one piece of lino I had in the basement.</p>

<p>I had decided to see if I could make a printing plate by laser etching the
linoleum. There was no way I could afford to have a proper plate made, and I
already had access to the Foundry’s laser cutter. Needless, to say, laser
etching seemed like an easy option. As it turns out, very few printmakers have
used this technique. It was difficult to find any information about exactly
how to cut the plate without ruining it. (As a note, this was several years
ago, and there’s quite a bit more information out there on this technique
now).</p>

<p>Eventually, I was able to get in touch a designer by the name of Robin Hanhart
who had been playing with this technique. He gave me some point pointers and
it looked like smooth sailing was ahead.</p>

<p>As it turns out, low grade water-based ink doesn’t do too well in a high
humidity environment like the one I was printing in. Now I had a plate and a
press, but everything I tried to print would refuse to dry and ended up
smudged beyond the charming point of &ldquo;that handmade look&rdquo;.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-02-21-made-from-scratch/card-rough.jpg" alt="Rough prints"></p>

<p>It looked like I had just wasted the last week and the last of my money on
some stupid endeavor that wouldn’t pay off. I started thinking, “if I needed
Thank You cards, why didn’t I just go pick some up at the store?” Suffice to
say, this experience was not what you would call “positive”.</p>

<p>I had to put my little printmaking idea on the back burner for a while, and
focus on other things. I felt foolish and as if the whole thing was a waste.</p>

<h2>Making Something Is Never A Waste Of Time</h2>

<p>Yes, there is a happy ending to this story. After giving up on my silly little
side project, I met Scott Moore, an expert printmaker who joined the Idea
Foundry to laser cut his own wood type. I showed him my press and the laser-
etched plate, and we were off. Scott gave me not only great advice, but a
couple jars of nice rubber-based ink to play with.</p>

<p>Reinvigorated, I got back to the press and gave it a whirl. This time,
success. Within an hour I had 30 Thank You cards, hand-lettered and hand-
printed on a handmade printing press.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-02-21-made-from-scratch/card-fin.jpg" alt="The final print"></p>

<p>These cards didn’t save my freelance business, they didn’t spinoff into a line
of profitable products, and I’ve since left the press behind. The point isn’t
to turn your long, hard, stupid side projects into money. The point is that
sweating, struggling, and making something from scratch is rewarding in its
own right. The ups and downs of creative work can be frustrating, but
honestly, I wouldn’t trade anything for that moment when a long, hard, stupid
project finally pays off.</p>

<h2>Bonus Round</h2>

<p>I was so excited on finishing this ridiculously laborious process that I
decided to immediately send out a few of the printed cards. These went out,
mostly, to designers I’ve never met, but whose work and thoughts I’ve found
helpful.</p>

<p>Most of them didn’t respond. One did.</p>

<p>I’ve never met James Victore, but I watch his video series from time to time,
and I sent him one of my stupidly frustrating cards. About a week later, I
tuned into his YouTube channel, and just about lost it when he held up the
card that I printed.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-02-21-made-from-scratch/jamesvictore.jpg" alt="James Victore got my thanks"></p>

<p>That feeling was one that I couldn’t buy, and no level of efficiency could
ever achieve.</p>
