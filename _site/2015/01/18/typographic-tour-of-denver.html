		<p class="post-excerpt">I&rsquo;m new to Denver, I don&rsquo;t know my way around, and I love typography and lettering. So last weekend, I decided to go on a typographic tour of the city. I hopped on my bike and set out from Washington Park north to Five Points, and back down to Broadway.</p>
		<p>I stopped wherever something caught my eye, and I focused on less commonplace
compositions, or at least pieces that made me think.</p>

<p>What I found was tremendously diverse typographic landscape that teaches
history lessons, creates landmarks across the city, and helps create a unique
sense of place.</p>

<p>Here are the highlights:</p>

<h2>Downtown</h2>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/16thStMural.jpg" alt="16th St Mural"></p>

<p>First up, this street mural downtown. A real treat for any type enthusiast
with an all-you-can eat buffet of different styles and influences, perhaps an
expression of the city’s diversity and bright atmosphere. We can see a lot of
stylistic influences at play: sign-painting, script lettering, decorative
numerals, all wrapped in a vibrant color palette and impressively executed
mostly with spray paint cans.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/ThirstyLion.jpg" alt="Neon and blackletter"></p>

<p>Perfect example of why you should never wear suspenders if you’re already
wearing a belt. Mashing up blackletter with neon is risky business, and
encasing it in metal isn’t quite helping. Still, this is a unique approach.</p>

<h2>LoDo</h2>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/BenMoore.jpg" alt="Benjamin Moore Paints sign"></p>

<p>Lower downtown is a treasure trove of well-preserved antique type. From a
contemporary craft perspective, this sign is a mess: three font size in two
styles and awful kerning to boot. Nonetheless, the larger-than-life display is
striking, even today and works as a landmark.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/EyeCandy.jpg" alt="Eye Candy"></p>

<p>Old-school meet new-school. This sign proves that you don’t need neon, massive
size, or the latest trendy display face to stand out. Here we have a didone
face rendered in metal (CNC’ed I’m guessing) that creates a unique visual
character. And the ostrich is a nice touch.</p>

<h2>Denver Pavilions</h2>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/DenverPavilions.jpg" alt="Denver Pavilions"></p>

<p>Getting a shot of this entire composition was near impossible, but it would
miss the point anyway. This is a great example of designing type around
restrictions imposed by material and fabrication. The scale is impressive and
the result is a unique set of letters in the grey area between type and
lettering. There’s a typeface here just waiting to be designed.</p>

<h2>Broadway</h2>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Cleaners.jpg" alt="Cleaners on Broadway"></p>

<p>This was too awesomely bad to pass up. What you might call a “shotgun”
approach, we’ve got hand-painted type alongside window vinyl and a
dime-a-dozen plastic sign, just in case you weren’t sure what they do here.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Historian.jpg" alt="The Historian"></p>

<p>Five typefaces? Six? And how many styles? I’m not sure what to look at here.
And what’s “Blackend Chicken”?</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Imperial.jpg" alt="The Imperial"></p>

<p>There’s a good bit of gold leaf in this gold rush city. This is just one
example, but the same technique is employed all over Denver.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Mayan.jpg" alt="The Mayan Theater"></p>

<p>This is impressive to say the least. It’s old, it’s huge, and it’s intricate.
And talk about personality.</p>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Skylark.jpg" alt="Skylark Lounge"></p>

<p>It’s like we stepped into a time machine and ended up at a circus. There’s a
fair bit of patina on this sign, but that “Skylark” lettering could make any
Dribbbler swoon.</p>

<h2>Washington Park</h2>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Esquire.jpg" alt="The Esquire"></p>

<p>This eclectic sign caught me eye right off the bat. This art deco styling
isn’t common elsewhere in the city and that first “E” and the “Q” give this a
sort of syncopated rhythm. It isn’t “good” but it’s certainly memorable.</p>

<h2>Capitol Hill</h2>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Hookah.jpg" alt="Hand painted delivery sign"></p>

<p>Sign painting isn’t dead! It’s refreshing to see this approach employed
instead of cheap generic vinyl.</p>

<h2>Union Station</h2>

<p><img src="/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/UnionStation.jpg" alt="Union Station"></p>

<p>Of course, I had to stop by Union Station. This has got to be some of the most
iconic type in Denver. There are layers of history here in the facade alone.</p>

<p>So, that’s it. OK so that’s not <em>it,</em>that’s just what I saw one sunny
Saturday afternoon. I’m sure there’s a lot more to this city’s typographic
landscape, and I look forward to getting to know it well.</p>
