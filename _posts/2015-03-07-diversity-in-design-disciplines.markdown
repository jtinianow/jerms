We designers come in all shapes and sizes. Some focus on branding, others on print design, while some have a penchant for interactive work.

Ask ten designers their opinion on the relative merits of generalization and specialization, and you’ll get ten different answers. Browse any design blog or newsfeed, and you’ll inevitably find a handful of articles about “unicorns” and (mostly) how they don’t exist.

This troubles me. Design disciplines, especially graphic design, have always been agglomerations of formerly disparate skill sets. We are enabled to bring these skill sets together with new technology, rapidly evolving as ever.

A hundred years ago, specialization was important. You wouldn’t hire an illustrator to set type, and you wouldn’t ask a typesetter to take photos. These things were hard to do and time-intensive. One person simply could not do it all.

Then came the computer. Software enabled an individual to set type, edit photos, create images, and edit text, all from a single tool. Then came the internet, enabling us to share techniques and resources across the planet.

I digress. The point is, “graphic design” as we know it today wouldn’t exist if some brave souls hadn’t taken the risk of mixing disciplines. Our trade is built on a framework of multiple disciplines.

Think about Emigré magazine, where the same team designing the layout was creating bespoke fonts for every issue. Think about Charles and Ray Eames making films, designing chairs, and creating beautiful graphics.

## Don’t Expect to Master Everything Immediately

> &ldquo;To design is to communicate by whatever means you can control or master.&rdquo;
>> — Milton Glaser

I may be reading too much into it, but Mr. Glaser’s phrasing is telling here. To communicate by whatever means you can first control and then master. Nit picking is counterproductive.

Shipping mentality has its fair share of critics. We don’t want to chug out more of lower quality faster. Nonetheless, with the exception of a few prodigies, no one can master a medium over night. If you want to get to Carnegie Hall, the best route is practice.

Everyone’s got a thing, and that’s perfectly fine. I’m not proposing that we should all be trying to do everything equally well. I’m not proposing that we all be unicorns, I’m saying that we can all be mutts. After all, mutts are more even tempered and don’t have the same genetic problems as pure-breeds.

Here’s another quote:  

> &ldquo;An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail.&rdquo;
>> — Edwin Land

And if you’re concerned that the time you spend doing something not-so-well is a waste, stop right there. First, the time you “waste” is going to pass either way and once it’s gone, nothing can bring it back. Second, it’s never a waste if you learn something — Sam Morris explains this beautifully and concisely [here](http://sammorr.is/blog/2015/03/05/list-of-shame/).

## 1. Designers Should Write

At a bare minimum, every designer should learn how to write. Not just syntax and vocabulary, but how to actually communicate. Speaking from experience, this will benefit every aspect of your practice, from contract work to client communication.

Of course, your writing doesn’t have to be perfect or even great, or even for that matter much good. Chances are that if your a visual person (like myself), writing is a challenge. Challenges are good for creativity. They force us to frame problems differently and prevent us from taking the same approach to every project.

Conversely, every designer should read. Fiction especially.

#### 2. Designers Should Write Code

This is a big one. I understand the trepidation — I’ve been there myself not too long ago. Code is scary. Code is also easier to learn than ever. Start with HTML and CSS, then Javascript, and PHP is rather forgiving for beginners. Once you’ve got the core concepts down you’ll be able, at the very least, to communicate more effectively with your developer colleagues.

No, I’m not going to point you to resources where you can learn online. I promise I’m not just being rude. The fact of the matter is, you need to just build something. It doesn’t need to be perfect — that’s the beautiful thing about code. There’s virtually zero overhead and iteration is easy. Whatever software your laptop came with is enough to get started.

Writing code (okay, HTML and CSS) isn’t a huge departure from what you already do. If you’ve ever used character styles, CSS will put a big ol’ smile on your face.

## 3. …

I’ve kept the last two points intentionally brief. These two are the pursuits I’ve found most beneficial in my own practice, but like I said, everyone’s got a thing. Maybe yours is 3D modeling, or videography, or improv.

The specifics are irrelevant. The point is simple: let’s mix our disciplines up a bit. Let’s diversify the design gene pool.
