title:  "Start With Why"
subtitle: "Or, Why Not"
excerpt: "The last ten weeks, I’ve been hearing a certain phrase quite a bit inside the walls of Boulder Digital Works. The phrase, “start with why,” has been in the back of my mind for two-and-a-half months."

And to be honest, I’ve had a bit of trouble answering its followup cousin, “what’s your why?”. Not in the scope of specific projects, but in the bigger picture.

The question, “what’s your why?” I’ll admit, is a useful tool for individual endeavors. Defining goals and setting a scope helps a project move along efficiently and stay on track. But I’m troubled by the idea of applying the same question to my overarching motivation as a designer, an idea which seems rather pervasive in our studio. And where exactly did this idea come from?

## There are more than ten products for sale on Simon Sinek’s homepage.

Result number one of a Google search for “start with why”, startwithwhy.com, reads more like an e-commerce landing page than a manifesto.

As a designer, I embrace commerce hand-in-hand with creativity. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with selling an idea (or in this case, selling the shit out of an idea). In fact, I’ve heard great things about Mr. Sinek’s work from colleagues and classmates. I’ve seen the results of his theories firsthand, and they’re quite impressive.

## And they’re all branded with beautiful consistency.

Remember that time a few years ago when Banksy pasted up a bunch of Che Guevera portraits on a bridge in West London? He was, “trying to make a statement about the endless recycling of an icon by endlessly recycling an icon.” This is what irks me about Mr. Sinek’s monopoly on a certain three-word phrase.

“Start with why” the phrase now looks and feels more like a product than a philosophy, and every product has a shelf life. No, I’m not proposing that this hard-earned work should be given away for free, merely questioning its longevity compared to the length of an entire lifetime of creative work.

Minds change often and there’s nothing wrong with that. Trends come and go, and there’s always a new flavor of the month. The thing is, I’m in this whole design thing for the long haul, and I don’t plan on building the foundation of my practice on shaky catch-phrases.

Rather, I’m advocating on the part of critical thinking as a core component of that creative philosophy. Let’s go on our adventures and write our own stories. It’s not as easy, and you can’t find it on Google, but your own story doesn’t have a shelf life.

This is a stencil painted on the sidewalk in front of my apartment. It reads, “Love is a place where logic seldom goes”. My thanks to the artist for saving me a $129 workshop fee.

I don’t have a “why” for being a designer. I have a passion for what I do. And I’ll take the latter over the former any day of the week.
