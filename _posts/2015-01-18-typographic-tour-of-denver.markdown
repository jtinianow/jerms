title:  "A Typographic Tour of Denver, CO"
subtitle: "Hello. My name is Jeremy and I&rsquo;m a typoholic. No, I&rsquo;m not addicted to typohol."
excerpt: "I&rsquo;m new to Denver, I don&rsquo;t know my way around, and I love typography and lettering. So last weekend, I decided to go on a typographic tour of the city. I hopped on my bike and set out from Washington Park north to Five Points, and back down to Broadway."

I stopped wherever something caught my eye, and I focused on less commonplace
compositions, or at least pieces that made me think.

What I found was tremendously diverse typographic landscape that teaches
history lessons, creates landmarks across the city, and helps create a unique
sense of place.

Here are the highlights:

## Downtown

First up, this street mural downtown. A real treat for any type enthusiast
with an all-you-can eat buffet of different styles and influences, perhaps an
expression of the city’s diversity and bright atmosphere. We can see a lot of
stylistic influences at play: sign-painting, script lettering, decorative
numerals, all wrapped in a vibrant color palette and impressively executed
mostly with spray paint cans.

![Neon and blackletter](/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/ThirstyLion.jpg)

Perfect example of why you should never wear suspenders if you’re already
wearing a belt. Mashing up blackletter with neon is risky business, and
encasing it in metal isn’t quite helping. Still, this is a unique approach.


## LoDo

Lower downtown is a treasure trove of well-preserved antique type. From a
contemporary craft perspective, this sign is a mess: three font size in two
styles and awful kerning to boot. Nonetheless, the larger-than-life display is
striking, even today and works as a landmark.

![Eye Candy](/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/EyeCandy.jpg)

Old-school meet new-school. This sign proves that you don’t need neon, massive
size, or the latest trendy display face to stand out. Here we have a didone
face rendered in metal (CNC’ed I’m guessing) that creates a unique visual
character. And the ostrich is a nice touch.

## Denver Pavilions

Getting a shot of this entire composition was near impossible, but it would
miss the point anyway. This is a great example of designing type around
restrictions imposed by material and fabrication. The scale is impressive and
the result is a unique set of letters in the grey area between type and
lettering. There’s a typeface here just waiting to be designed.

## Broadway

This was too awesomely bad to pass up. What you might call a “shotgun”
approach, we’ve got hand-painted type alongside window vinyl and a
dime-a-dozen plastic sign, just in case you weren’t sure what they do here.

![The Historian](/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Historian.jpg)

Five typefaces? Six? And how many styles? I’m not sure what to look at here.
And what’s “Blackend Chicken”?

![The Imperial](/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Imperial.jpg)

There’s a good bit of gold leaf in this gold rush city. This is just one
example, but the same technique is employed all over Denver.

![The Mayan Theater](/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Mayan.jpg)

This is impressive to say the least. It’s old, it’s huge, and it’s intricate.
And talk about personality.

![Skylark Lounge](/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Skylark.jpg)

It’s like we stepped into a time machine and ended up at a circus. There’s a
fair bit of patina on this sign, but that “Skylark” lettering could make any
Dribbbler swoon.

## Washington Park

![The Esquire](/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Esquire.jpg)

This eclectic sign caught me eye right off the bat. This art deco styling
isn’t common elsewhere in the city and that first “E” and the “Q” give this a
sort of syncopated rhythm. It isn’t “good” but it’s certainly memorable.

## Capitol Hill

![Hand painted delivery sign](/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/Hookah.jpg)

Sign painting isn’t dead! It’s refreshing to see this approach employed
instead of cheap generic vinyl.

## Union Station

![Union Station](/content/2015-01-18-typographic-tour-of-denver/UnionStation.jpg)

Of course, I had to stop by Union Station. This has got to be some of the most
iconic type in Denver. There are layers of history here in the facade alone.

So, that’s it. OK so that’s not _it,_that’s just what I saw one sunny
Saturday afternoon. I’m sure there’s a lot more to this city’s typographic
landscape, and I look forward to getting to know it well.
